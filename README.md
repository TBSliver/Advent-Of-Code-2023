# Adent of Code 2023

Here are my entries to Advent of Code 2023

## Setup

With a standard perl setup (see [Here](https://paste.tbsliver.me/cpanm) for a script to set one up), run the following commands:

```
cpanm --installdeps .
```

Then you can run the script for solving - eg. for day 1, puzzle 1, run the following:

```
./bin/solve -d 1 -p 1 'R2, R3'
```

And the answer will be printed out (in this case, 5).
